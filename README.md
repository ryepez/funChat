## DareChat app

**DareChat** is an app that allow users to create group and individual chats. I create this app as my final project for Udacity's nano degree in iOS. If you need an account, you can create one on the welcome page. The app uses Core Data, and Firebase. The intended user is anyone that want to play around with a chat app.
