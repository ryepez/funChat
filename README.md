## DareChat app

### App Description
**DareChat** is an app that allows users to create group and individual chats. It allows you to send images and text. Also, it allows you to save images of chats on the phone.

I created this app as my final project for Udacity's iOS nanodegree. It can be used as a template for chat features for other apps. The app uses Core Data and Firebase. The intended user is anyone who wants to play around with a chat app.
